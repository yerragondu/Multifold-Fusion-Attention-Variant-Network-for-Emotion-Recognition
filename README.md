## 🔍 Abstract

This paper introduces a **Multifold Fusion Attention Variant** model for emotion recognition, combining cross-spatial attention mechanisms with variant embedding fusion to improve classification performance and robustness.

---

## 🎯 Highlights

- Developed a novel attention-based architecture to refine emotion recognition using EEG and audio data
- Achieved improved accuracy and generalization by reducing overfitting through embedding fusion and cross-spatial variant modeling
- Applied in real-world use cases like **mental health monitoring** and **assistive medical systems**
- Demonstrated robustness across emotional states under noisy conditions
